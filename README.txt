Game Walkthrough
- Level One
    the checkpoints are the grey swirl rock things
    and for the finish you kind of need to wiggle
    back and forth on it a bit for the game to get 
    it to recognize. I tried to fix this but nothing
    I did would help.

- Level Two
    remember that you have a dash on (Q / E)
    and the fact that the jump that you have does not 
    expire when you are in mid air.

- Level Three
    recall that spikes make you lose a life
    and for the rightmost jump, you have to dash into
    the corner of the upper block in order to complete
    the jump and land on top :) GOOD LUCK.
